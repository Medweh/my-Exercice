# My Exercise

This is my final project notebook for data science.
 

## Running Tests

Install the test dependencies and execute `pytest`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you track dependencies
pytest
```

This will run the notebook using `nbconvert` and fail if there are execution errors.
