# My Exercise

This is my final project notebook for data science.

## Predictive Control Example

The script `predictive_control.py` demonstrates a simple model predictive control
algorithm. Install the required packages and run the script:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
python3 predictive_control.py
```

The script plots the process outputs `y1` and `y2` alongside their setpoints
`w1` and `w2`.
